# Formula-1-Rear-Wing-CFD-Analysis-using-ANSYS-Fluent
This repository presents a detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of a Formula 1 rear wing using ANSYS Fluent. The project includes all phases from geometry creation in SolidWorks to meshing, boundary condition setup, solver configuration, and post-processing for flow field analysis.
